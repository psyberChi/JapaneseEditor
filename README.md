# Japanese Vocabulary Editor

**Note: This program in still in alpha development and not fully functional.**

A program that helps organize vocabulary items that you're learning. It allows you to organize by category and lesson. The files are stored in JSON format.

## Features

Each vocabulary entry has five components:

* English
* Romaji
* Kana
* Kanji
* Lesson

Only the English entry is required. Not all words have a Kanji equivalent to enter in. The lesson is just a numerical value and is optional. It can be helpful if you're working through a book and want to capture what chapter or lesson it came from.

## Preferences

The current preferences allow you to:

* Set the font family and size for the lists and entry editor panel. Each section has its own font controls. This allows you to make the kana and kanji portions larger for easier viewing.
* The window position and size will automatically be saved and loaded.
* Recent files will also be automatically stored and accessed from the _File_ menu.
